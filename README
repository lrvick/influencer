 Sokral < http://sokral.us >

WHAT IS SOKRAL?
	A social media crawling and search engine, built on django. Aims to
	provide an easy and flexible framework for building applications that
	thrive on a wide range of constantly updated social data. Sokral will get
	you up and running with the ability to search and scrape media and
	information from a wide range of social networking services.

CURRENT FEATURES:

 * Ability to harvest user profile information, tweets, and URLS from Twitter

 * Ability to expand all short-urls into full real URLS.

NOTES

  Many more features coming soon as this project is under active development.

	This is by no means production-ready code. Do not actually use it in
	production unless you wish to be eaten by a grue.

  Visit http://sokral.us for a live populated demo of the latest source code.
